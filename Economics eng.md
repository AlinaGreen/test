#### <a id="_922kqstcu473"></a>Business model description

The NEURON business model is based on charging a commission fee for giving Neuronplatform customers the possibility to acquire, top up and combine balances on their crypto- and fiat accounts and to use freely those combined funds when making transfers and/or settlements for goods and services. The possibility to acquire and top up crypto accounts is made available as early as the platform’s kick-off phase, while NEURON’s own payment system will, in the future, enable customers to top up their crypto wallets by transferring fiat money to the NEURON payment system and similarly to transfer funds from their crypto wallet to their fiat account at the same time\. 

The possibility to acquire and top up crypto accounts is made available as early as the platform’s kick-off phase, while NEURON’s own payment system will, in the future, enable customers to top up their crypto wallets by transferring fiat money to the NEURON payment system and similarly to transfer funds from their crypto wallet to their fiat account at the same time\. 

Once the EMI license is received and branches of its own payment system are up and running around the world, NEURON will make available correspondent accounts in the national currencies in the regions of its presence, thus enabling customers to top up fiat accounts and make cryptocurrency-fiat-cryptocurrency conversions without having to account for local exchange differences\. 

The project’s business model has used data on internal debit transactions (between the bank’s customer accounts), external payments (transactions with other banks’ customers), as well as external payments performed by customers without a bank account\. The calculation has used a selection of payments actually made within a period of 10 months\. For the sake of forecasting accuracy the data have been averaged\.

__Expense structure__

The platform revenues are made up of the following:

| __Commission fees__ | __Fixed__ | __Percentage__ |
|---|---|---|
| Average bill | $148,28 |  |
| Non-recurrent card issue fee | 10,00 | 1,48% |
| Account-to-account transfer fee |  | 0,50% |
| Rate fee |  | 3,50% |
| Card service fee/month | 2,00 | 0,30% |
| Cash withdrawal/transfer to fiat fee |  | 3,00% |
| ICO fee |  | 5,00% |
| Р2Р exchange fee |  | 1,00% |
| Merchant account fee |  | 0,50% |
| __Platform total profitability__ |  | __15,28%__ |
|   |   |   |

An average bill has been calculated by analyzing debit transactions of customers with active accounts with at least one transaction registered in the period under review\. The average bill amount has been determined by dividing the sum total for all customers’ debit transactions over 10 months by their number\.

Revenue per customer has been calculated on the basis of data on revenue account turnover in the bank’s balance sheet \(fees received from customer transactions were taken from revenue accounts\) for 10 months\. Revenue per customer has been determined by dividing the amount of fee revenue received in said period by the number of customers who owned accounts and actually paid all established fees\. 

#### <a id="_fn3o1w8ri19d"></a>3. Branch development table

Expansion into new regions will continue in accordance with the licensing plan and will be driven by the need to open own correspondent accounts in the countries of presence thus enabling integration of fiat accounts with customer crypto accounts and service of those accounts within the payment system being developed. As a result, payment transactions will grow cheaper
\.

#### <a id="_yjsf9l54phkc"></a>4. Licensing plan

Licensing includes expenses associated with government regulation processes and is tied to the EMI general license. In order to receive the license, no additional expenses will be required apart from those listed in the table with a few region-specific assumptions\.

| __License API application investments__ |   |
|-----------------------------------------|---|
| Annual supervisory fee | $3 360,00 |
| Company establishment | $560,00 |
| State duty for a license | $1 008,00 |
| Legal fees | $33 600,00 |
| Additional expenses \(translation, notary fees\) | $896,00 |
| Application documents preparation | $33 600,00 |
| Opening of two safeguarding accounts \* | $8 960,00 |
| Total for licensing | __$81 984,00__ |

#### <a id="_ir8h51do1wbc"></a>5. Customer growth ratio

Data on customer growth ratio have been taken from an existing fiat currency payment business covering the period of one year and have been averaged by months. Judging by global cryptocurrency user growth ratio in the last six months, we have reason to believe that said targets will be easily achieved\.

![Customer's growth ratio](images/4.png)

#### <a id="_1x56e4i9lqk5"></a>6. Customer growth table

The table contains data on the expected growth in the number of customers broken down by region\.

#### <a id="_6ymir71m8ecj"></a>7. Expense structure

The table shows percentage of expense types in the total expenses\.

| __EXPENSES__ |   |
|---|---|
| Branches dev exp HR | 12,05% |
| Branches monthly exp | 4,38% |
| Development| 53,77% |
| Licensing | 3,17% |
| Advert exp | 11,22% |
| Liquidity support | 9,81% |
| Сustomer's support fund | 5,60% |
| Bounty & bugs | 1,41% |
| Bonuses | 18,91% |
| Founders | 14,13% |
| Advisors & Consultants | 2,52% |

#### <a id="_nkr3bqdp72ey"></a>8. Revenue structure

The platform’s revenue structure is sufficiently diversified and lies within the market range, which gives it a competitive edge\. The large fixed-revenue share testifies to a relative independence of the platform’s total revenue from a turnover on customer accounts\. The ICO commission fee being part of the revenue structure reduces dependence of the platform’s revenue on payment service fees.\. The table below shows types of revenue and their percentage ratios in the platform’s total revenue\.

|  __Fees__ |   |
|---|---|
| Fixed fee\., $  | 29,81%  |
|  Platform’s transfer fee | 3,72%  |
| Rate fee  |  26,01% |
|  Plastic fee | 5,96%  |
|  Payment processing fee | 0,00%  |
| Cash withdrawal/transfer to fiat fee  | 11,15%  |
|  ICO fee | 15,19%  |
| Р2Р exchange fee  | 7,43%  |
|  Merchant account fee | 0,74%  |
